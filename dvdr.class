!!! The aim of this script is to calculate the velocity gradient for a virialized gas, for a given volume H2 density.

!!! Formulae are from Papadopoulos et al. 1999 ApJ 516 114 
!!   alpha:  geometry of molecular cloud 
!!   density: volume density of H2 of the molecular cloud

!!! dvdr  alpha density  

define double alpha density dvdr 
let alpha &1
let density &2

let dvdr 0.65*(alpha^0.5)*(density/1e3)^0.5 

say "dvdr (virialized)= " 'dvdr' "  km/s/pc"
