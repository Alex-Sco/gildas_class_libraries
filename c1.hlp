1 C1
  C1 is designed to fill the bad channels with the rms noise of all other channels. 
       C1 Arg1 

       Arg1 is the cutoff limit of sigma.

       EXAMPLE:
       c1 5

       It fills bad channels with a random noise within 1 sigma, and the definition
       for bad channels is: the channels deviate more than 5 sigma from baseline.
