!!! The aim of this script is to calculate molecular mass from CI 1-0 luminosity under LTE assumptions.  
!!! revised at 01 Sep.  2013  15:30; 
!!! Formulae are from Wei√ü et al. 2005
!!   ciMass: CI mass
!!   H2Mass: H2 mass 
!!   Lci10 line luminosity  of CI1-0 in Kkm/spc-2
!!   Tex:  excitation temperature 
!!   T1 and T2 are energies above the ground state for CI 1-0 
!!   Q: partition function of three energy system 
!!! useage:  
!!! 
!!! massCI10 Tex   L'(CI1-0)   

define double ciMass Lci10  Tex  T1 T2 Q H2Mass
let T1 23.6  ! K; energy above the ground state for CI 1-0 
let T2 62.5  ! K; energy above the ground state for CI 2-1 

let Tex &1
let Lci10 &2

let Q (1.+3.*exp(-1*T1/Tex)+5*exp(-1*T2/Tex))
let ciMass 5.706e-4*Q*1/3*exp(23.6/Tex)*Lci10
let h2mass cimass/5e-5/6

say "M(CI)=" 'ciMass' "Msun"
say "M(H2)=" 'H2Mass' "Msun"
